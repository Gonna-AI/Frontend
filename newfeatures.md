Overview

Demo:

A Call Agent (1) is connected to a Dashboard (2).

The Call Agent handles the phone call with the customer, while the Dashboard allows the user to monitor, control, and review the conversation.

Dashboard Functionality (2)

In the Dashboard, the user should be able to:

See the entire call dialog between the Call Agent (1) and the customer in real time

View the full conversation history after the call ends

Edit and change the questions that the Call Agent will ask during the call

Call Flow (Step by Step)
1. Call Start – First Question

The Call Agent starts the call with an initial question:

Example first question:

“Hello, I am the call agent for ClerkTree. Are you a new customer or an existing customer?”

➡️ This first question can be easily changed in the Dashboard before or during the demo.

2. Access to Personal Information

In this example, the Call Agent already has access to personal information about the customer:

Name: Shobit

Age: 24 years old

Medical context: Dementia suspicion

(This is for demo purposes only.)

3. Identity Verification

After the user says their name, the Call Agent verifies the identity by asking:

“Are you Shobit, 24 years old, and was your last appointment due to a dementia suspicion?”

This step is used to confirm that the correct person is on the call.

4. Context-Specific Questions

After successful verification, the Call Agent asks specific questions related to dementia, based on predefined logic.

These questions:

Are configurable

Can be changed in the Dashboard

Adapt to the conversation flow

5. End of the Call

At the end of the call:

The Call Agent finishes the conversation

The entire call dialog is clearly displayed in the Dashboard

The conversation is stored and can be reviewed later

Demo Highlight: Easy Question Editing

If possible, the demo should also show:

How easily the user can change the first question

How modifying a question in the Dashboard immediately affects the next call
